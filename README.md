## 📊 **BUSINESS LOGIC**

### **Settlement Calculation**
```javascript
// Owner Operator Settlement Example
const grossPay = loadRevenue * driverPayPercentage;  // e.g., $3000 * 0.88 = $2640
const expenses = getCompanyPaidExpenses(driverId);   // Auto-populated: $500 fuel + $200 insurance
const netPay = Math.max(0, grossPay - expenses);    // $2640 - $700 = $1940
```

### **P&L Calculation**
```javascript
// Company Revenue (excludes O/O expenses to prevent double-counting)
const companyRevenue = companyDriverLoads.total + ownerOperatorLoads.commission;
const companyExpenses = expenses.filter(e => !isOwnerOperatorExpense(e));
const netProfit = companyRevenue - companyExpenses - actualDriverPay;
```
