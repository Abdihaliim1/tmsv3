## 📋 Action Required

### Add Logo Image
You need to add the ATS FREIGHT LLC logo image to the system:

1. **Save the logo image** as: `resources/ats-freight-logo.png`
   - Recommended size: 200x200px or larger
   - Format: PNG with transparent background (preferred)
   - The logo should be the circular emblem with truck and "ATS FREIGHT LLC" text

2. **Alternative**: If you have the logo in a different format:
   - Convert to PNG
   - Place in `resources/` folder
   - Update the path in all HTML files if using a different filename

### Logo Path Reference
The system expects the logo at:
```
/resources/ats-freight-logo.png
```

If the logo file is missing, the system will automatically show "ATS" as a text fallback.
