# Deployment Information Needed

To deploy your TMS system, I need:

## Required Information

1. **Google Cloud Account Email**
   - Example: `your-email@gmail.com` or `your-email@company.com`

2. **Project ID** (or I'll create one)
   - If you have an existing project: provide the project ID
   - If not: I'll create a new one (just give me a name)

3. **Domain Name**
   - Example: `mydomain.com`
   - This is where your companies will be accessed (company1.mydomain.com)

4. **Billing**
   - Is billing enabled on your Google Cloud account?
   - (Required for Cloud Run and Load Balancer)

---

## What I'll Do

Once you provide this info, I'll:

1. ✅ Authenticate with your Google Cloud account (opens browser)
2. ✅ Set up or select your project
3. ✅ Enable all required APIs
4. ✅ Deploy the application to Cloud Run
5. ✅ Set up load balancer with SSL
6. ✅ Configure everything for multi-tenant access

## Security Note

- I will NOT ask for your password
- Authentication will open a browser window for you to sign in securely
- All credentials are handled by Google's secure authentication system

---

**Please provide:**
- Your Google Cloud email
- Project ID (or "create new")
- Your domain name

Then I'll start the deployment! 🚀
